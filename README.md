## Video Calling App

## Description
This project involves developing a video calling application leveraging the Stream SDK for real-time communication. The app is built using Kotlin, incorporating Kotlin Serialization for data management, Koin for dependency injection, and Navigation Compose for seamless navigation between screens. The focus is on delivering a smooth and reliable video calling experience with efficient dependency management and clean architecture.

## Features
-Real-time video and audio calling with the Stream SDK.
-Efficient data management using Kotlin Serialization.
-Dependency injection with Koin for modular and testable code.
-Smooth navigation between different screens using Navigation Compose.
## Technologies Used
-Stream SDK: For implementing real-time video and audio calling functionality.
-Kotlin Serialization: For handling data serialization and deserialization.
-Koin: For dependency injection, promoting clean and maintainable code.
-Navigation Compose: For managing navigation and screen transitions.
